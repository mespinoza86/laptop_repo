          WireGuard is a secure, fast, and easy to use replacement for IPSec
          that uses modern cryptography and clever networking tricks. It's
          designed to be fairly general purpose and abstract enough to fit most
          use cases, while at the same time remaining extremely simple to
          configure. See www.wireguard.com for more info.

          It's safe to say Y or M here, as the driver is very lightweight and
          is only in use when an administrator chooses to add an interface.
